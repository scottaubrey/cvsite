                A dedicated technical leader, I'm proficient in a number of technologies, both individually and as a 
                member of a techincal team. I'm well-versed in PHP and object oriented design, particularly in domain-driven 
                design, and I enjoy solving particularly difficult technical problems well and in a maintainable way. 
                I'm a life-long learner, not afraid to get stuck into a technology I'm unfamiliar with, and have a wide 
                understanding of many technologies to help design and kickstart new projects.

                <h4><mark>Sep 2018 &dash; present</mark> Head of Technology - <small>Christians Against Poverty</small></h4>
                <p>
                    Since September 2018 I have run the Technology department at Christians Against Poverty; managing 
                    the &pound;1.3m budget, line managing 3 team leaders and a program manager, and representing the 
                    Technology department at a senior management level. I have created and executed a change from 
                    project to product management, restructuring the System Development team around long-lived product 
                    teams, and fostering a greater collaboration between Development teams and senior stakeholders. I 
                    have also driven a greater emphasis on partnership, transparency and joint understanding of long 
                    term risks and opportunities in the internally developed systems, resulting in joint-sponsorship of 
                    Technology team investment by the charity's directors for other areas, winning multiple, multi-year 
                    Development team investments.

                    <h4><mark>Sep 2008 &dash; Dec 2014</mark> Systems Developer - <small>Christians Against Poverty</small></h4>
                    <p>
                        While still working as a helpdesk support, I was asked to work on the internal PHP-based systems 
                        after a development role was vacant for multiple months. After proving able to continue an 
                        existing project and create new systems while still achieving in my Helpdesk role, I was offered 
                        the role permanently. I was required to learn new skills, tools and ways of working to quickly 
                        create and maintain the growing number of developed systems using PHP, MySQL and MongoDB, and 
                        more than met the challenge, consistently achieving the praise of other developers for my 
                        abilities.

                    <h4><mark>Sep 2007 &dash;Aug 2008</mark> 2nd line Helpdesk support - <small>Christians Against Poverty</small></h4>
                    <p>
                        In late summer 2007, I started work in the I.T. department at Christians Against Poverty; a 
                        Bradford-based rapidly expanding christian charity with a national centre network. I was given 
                        the role of second line helpdesk support, providing in-person and on the phone support to the 
                        head office staff, and the centre staff around the country. Responsibilities included desktop 
                        support, network infrastructure and training, but I was soon involved with decisions about the 
                        charity server and network infrastructure. Here I further enhanced my unix administration 
                        skills, as well as helping the charity roll out it's Mac OS X-based server infrastructure for 
                        roaming.

                    <h4><mark>Dec 2005 &dash; Aug 2007</mark> Support Engineer - <small>Hi Tec Bradford</small></h4>
                    <p>
                        In 2005, I started work at Hi Tec Bradford, an Apple Authorised Service Provider and Solutions 
                        Expert for Education. I was offered a role as an Apple Macintosh engineer and sales assistant 
                        for the shop front. This required me to train on the Macintosh platform, and gave me invaluable 
                        knowledge because I was able to use my skills on the P.C. platform and apply them to the 
                        Macintosh, and due to the unix underpinnings of Mac OS X, I was able to develop my personal 
                        knowledge of unix systems administration. This knowledge allowed me to have a greater complexity 
                        to designing systems than other engineers that had dealt solely with Apple products. Due to my 
                        experience in network systems, my role soon evolved to include Macintosh network systems 
                        creation and on-site orientated tasks alongside my service responsibilities. I designed and 
                        setup many Macintosh-based networks, including Mac only environments, integrating 50 new Macs 
                        into an existing windows server environment for a school, and a school migration from Macintosh 
                        Manager and AppleShare IP OS9 environment to 10.4 server with 10.3 and classic, and Intel 10.4 
                        based clients. During my time with Hi-Tec, I studied and passed two Apple training exams and was 
                        able to achieve the Apple Certified Helpdesk Technician and Apple Certified Technical 
                        Coordinator certifications.

                    <h4><mark>2002 &dash; Dec 2005</mark> Workshop Engineer - <small>Hi Tec Bradford</small></h4>
                    <p>
                        Following my work experience, I was offered a part-time job as a basic engineer. This involved 
                        building new computer systems, basic assessments and repairs and virus and ad-ware removal and 
                        repair.

                    <p>
                        After leaving school, I was offered a full-time role within the company as a workshop engineer, 
                        with day release to college. As time progressed my duties within the company evolved to include 
                        being an on- site engineer, a database designer and a website programmer. This entailed more 
                        technical tasks such as network design, installation, repair and maintenance, network server 
                        design, maintenance and troubleshooting, on-site assistance, new P.C. installations and advice 
                        on new P.C's, dynamic website and Intranet/Internet management systems creation, as well as 
                        generic roles including stock management, customer relations, technical support and shop sales.

                    <p>
                        After upper school, I applied to join a HNC course in software engineering at Bradford College. I 
                        gained a place at 16 years old, 1 year younger than the minimum age they would normally allow. I 
                        attained 3 distinction grades for all 3 units during the first year. Unfortunately, due to personal 
                        circumstances I decided to delay the second year, and I was unable to re-attend a year later because 
                        the course syllabus had changed.

            <h2>Hobbies and other interests</h2>
                <p>
                    Aside from my interest in all things technical, I also play guitar and drums. I have been involved 
                    with bands in the past, and enjoy being a member of the worship leading team at my church. I also 
                    play as part of the ensemble worship team, and have played both guitar and drums regularly for 
                    Church services and events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My children are home educated, primarily by my wife, and we all enjoy learning together as a family. 
                    I help teach my son about computers and programming, and support him through his G.C.S.E. in 
                    computer science. I also enjoyed pitching in with all their subjects and interests, and especially 
                    trying to grow an appreciation of the history around us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also more recently grown an interest in video editing and post-production, particularly as the 
                    need grew to create online services and videos for our church during the COVID-19 pandemic. I 
                    particularly enjoy the combination of technical abilities, combined with the creative need to create 
                    a visually compelling package.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I passed my driving test in April 2005, and have enjoyed the freedom of easy traveling since that 
                    time.
